"""
Functions to check postcode variable in Pandas dataframe
========================================================

These functions take a dataframe containing postcode information and attempts
to correct errors and extract outward (first half), inward (second half) and
postcode area (first letters) components of the postcode.

In a similar vein, functions are also included to extract Ordnance Survey grid
references from column of free-text, correct typos, adjust to required accuracy
and convert to latitude and longitude.

    """Calculate the Damerau-Levenshtein distance between sequences.

    This distance is the number of additions, deletions, substitutions,
    and transpositions needed to transform the first sequence into the
    second. Although generally used with strings, any sequences of
    comparable objects will work.

    Transpositions are exchanges of *consecutive* characters; all other
    operations are self-explanatory.

    This implementation is O(N*M) time and O(M) space, for N and M the
    lengths of the two sequences.

    >>> dameraulevenshtein('ba', 'abc')
    2
    >>> dameraulevenshtein('fee', 'deed')
    2

    It works with arbitrary sequences too:
